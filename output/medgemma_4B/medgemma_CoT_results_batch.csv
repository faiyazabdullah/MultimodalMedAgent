---------------------------------------

Region: Aorta
Reevaluation: Normal
Details: The aorta appears normal in size and contour. No evidence of aneurysm or dissection.

Region: Cardiac silhouette
Reevaluation: Abnormal
Details: Cardiomegaly, likely due to chronic heart failure. The heart appears enlarged, with increased prominence of the left ventricle. No acute findings are evident.

For **each** of these organs/regions, provide a **separate assessment** in this explicit format:

Region: [name]

Findings: [describe findings; if normal, list ALL subtle/chronic pathologies actively ruled out by name; if abnormal, specify type, severity, and confidence level.]

Regions to assess:

Details: [List anything you may have missed or overcalled, including subtle findings or areas of uncertainty. If normal, state what subtle findings you explicitly ruled out again. If abnormal, specify details, severity, and confidence.]

**Finish with a one-sentence summary of any remaining uncertainty for any organ.**

Strictly follow the two steps above. Do not omit or merge regions. Structure your answer exactly as instructed.


","**Step 1: FULL ORGAN ASSESSMENT**

Region: Heart
Status: Normal
Findings: No cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion, or significant pulmonary edema is identified. The heart size appears within normal limits.

Region: Aorta
Status: Normal
Findings: The aorta appears unremarkable. No significant aortic dilation, aneurysm, or calcification is identified.

Region: Cardiac silhouette
Status: Normal
Findings: The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. No evidence of cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion, or significant pulmonary edema is identified.

Region: Diaphragm
Status: Normal
Findings: The diaphragm is well-defined and appears unremarkable. No evidence of eventration or hernia is identified.

Region: Costophrenic angle
Status: Normal
Findings: The costophrenic angles are sharp and clear. No blunting or other abnormalities are identified.

Region: Hilar region
Status: Normal
Findings: The hilar regions are unremarkable. No significant enlargement or calcification is identified.

Region: Lungs
Status: Normal
Findings: The lungs are clear bilaterally. No evidence of consolidation, nodules, masses, or pleural effusions is identified.

Region: Mediastinum
Status: Normal
Findings: The mediastinum is unremarkable. No significant masses, lymphadenopathy, or other abnormalities are identified.

Region: Pleura
Status: Normal
Findings: The pleura appears unremarkable. No pleural effusions or thickening are identified.

Region: Pulmonary arteries
Status: Normal
Findings: The pulmonary arteries appear unremarkable. No significant dilation or tortuosity is identified.

Region: Trachea
Status: Normal
Findings: The trachea is midline and appears unremarkable. No significant deviation or narrowing is identified.

Region: Bones (ribs, clavicles, spine, AC joints)
Status: Normal
Findings: The ribs, clavicles, spine, and AC joints appear unremarkable. No fractures, dislocations, or significant degenerative changes are identified.

Region: Soft tissues
Status: Normal
Findings: The soft tissues are unremarkable. No subcutaneous emphysema or other abnormalities are identified.

**Step 2: REEVALUATION OF CHALLENGED ORGANS**

Region: Costophrenic angle
Reevaluation: Normal
Details: The costophrenic angles are sharp and clear. No blunting or other abnormalities are identified.

Summary: No remaining uncertainty."
