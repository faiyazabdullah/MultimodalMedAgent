**Lungs and Pleura:** The lung fields are clear. No consolidation, infiltrates, or pneumothorax is identified. Vascular markings are normal. The pleura are unremarkable.

**Heart and Mediastinum:** The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size and contour. The mediastinal contour is normal.

**Aorta:** The visualized portion of the aorta appears normal.

**Pulmonary Arteries:** The main pulmonary arteries are not clearly delineated but appear within normal limits based on the visible structures.

**Diaphragm and Costophrenic Angles:** Both hemidiaphragms are well-defined and in their normal position. The right hemidiaphragm is slightly higher than the left, which is typical. The costophrenic angles are sharp and clear bilaterally.

**Trachea:** The trachea is midline.
